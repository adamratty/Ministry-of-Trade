# Busniess Regulations 

## Purpose and Scoope


Within the Province of British Columbia, our game and economy is massively impacted by businesses. Businesses help improve the gameâ€™s diversity, experience, and it helps increase the roleplay aspect. With the large selection and variety of types of businesses that you can establish, new features are always being added to the game! Businesses are licensed and regulated by the Department of Business Affairs.

In the Department of Business Affairs, our goal is not to be too restricting, our goal is to have guidelines setup so businesses can thrive and so that they are set up properly. By doing this, businesses are welcoming towards new employees, and welcoming to visit in game.

Businesses are not permitted to violate any DoBA policies, including those on this document, and those announced in the DoBA Discord Server.
